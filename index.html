	<h5>SQL Overview</h5>
	<p>For analytics in the private sector, SQL is almost a universal requirement for data retrieval, manipulation,
		cleaning, and segmentation. Corporations tend to rely heavily on Relational Databases, for which the SQL language
		was designed. If you're familiar with R or SAS or any other statistics-based programming language, SQL will probably 
		seem like a brand new language. At its core, SQL (Structured Query Language) involves <b>queries</b> of
		the objects within databases. A query tells the program what it requires from a database and how to structure the results. 
		Importantly, however, there are several procedural extensions to SQL, with PL/SQL (Oracle) and T-SQL (Microsoft) being 
		the most popular. These extensions bring procedural elements to SQL, such as logic and loops. SQL is almost exclusively 
		used with a procedural extension, which allows the user to customize the output through data definitions, etc.
		This guide relies on the T-SQL extension.</p>
