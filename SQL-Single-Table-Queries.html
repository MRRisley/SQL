  <h5 class="title">1. Intro to Single-Table Queries</h5>
	<p>Data within relational databases are stored in tables as observations, or <b>records</b>. Each record has one or more <b>fields</b>, or columns.
	If you're familiar with Excel Pivot tables, relational data are essentially the original, un-pivoted data.
	The table excerpt below demonstrates the structure of tables within relational databases.</p>
	<pre>

	</pre>
	
	
	
	Single-table queries are the foundation of SQL. A single-table query is simply what it says: a query on a single table. A query is (usually) a small program
	that specifies what to return from a table. Queries can "filter" results, they can aggregate results, and they can sort them. Imagine you work at a bank and have
	a table with checking accounts. You want to return checking accounts that are inactive. A pseudo-query may look like:</p>
	
	<pre><code>
select account#
from checkingaccountdata
where status = 'inactive'
	</code></pre>
	
	<p>The query can be read as follows: <code>select</code> the <code>account#</code> field from the <code>checkingaccountdata</code> table 
	for all records where another field, <code>status</code>, is equal to "inactive". Note that SQL is <b>NOT</b> case sensitive. It does not
	care whether you capitalize or not. This is not true for all programming languages, however.</p>

<div class="docs-section" id="intro">
  <h5 class="select">2. The <code>SELECT</code> Statement</h5>
	<p>The <code>SELECT</code> statement is the mother of all statements. The base requirement for a query is the <code>SELECT</code> statement. As shown above,
	this statement essentially tells the server precisely what you want to see. Without it, there is no query.</p>
	<p>Because the <code>SELECT</code> statement is the only required piece of a query, all other components are usually referred to as <b>clauses</b>,
	which are simply qualifiactions to the statement. Telling the statement what table to look at and how to look at it are common clauses--so common, in fact, that
    the distinction between the <code>SELECT</code> statement and the <code>FROM</code> clause is mostly a semantic issue.</p>	
	<p>I have only used the <code>SELECT</code> statement by itself in practice to perform basic operations. Unlike some programming languages, such as R or Excel VBA,
	SQL does not have a "console," which is essentially a command line. In other languages, this is where you could easily and quickly return a result, such as the 
	square root of 898. Without a console, the code must be written within the script:</p>	
	
		<pre><code>
select sqrt(898)
		</code></pre>
	
	<p>Note that these kind of operations in SQL are usually much more difficult to program than simply arriving at the answer using a calculator.
	This is due to a number of reasons, such as T-SQL not supporting complex numbers as well as floating-point precision. For example,</p> 

		<pre><code>
select 50/100
		</code></pre>
	
	<p>returns 1. This is because SQL reads 50 and 100 as integers and returns the nearest integer (i.e., 0.5 gets rounded to 1). For issues related to
	floating-point precision and numeric values, see <a href="../Programming/index.html#numeric">a description</a> of numeric variables in programming.</p>

	<p>Most applications of the <code>SELECT</code> statement will include use of a table. From a table, the statement will usually refer to fields, aggregations of fields,
	or manipulations of existing fields.</p>
	
			 <!-- Add example select statement -->  
			 
			 <div align="center"><a href = "#top"><h6>Top</h6></a></div>
	
	<p><b><code>SELECT *</code></b></p>
	<p>To return the complete contents of a table, you can simply use the <code>SELECT *</code> statement on a table.</p>
	
	<!-- Add example select statement -->  
	
	<p>Returns:</p>
	
	<!-- Add example select statement -->
	
	<p>This is a mostly useful statement in practice; however, it should not be used indiscriminantly. It is generally useful
	because when you enter a server used in the real world, it is likely that there will be many, many databases and many tables.
	The process of learning what is in them (fields and types of data) requires a query in most cases. However, if you don't understand 
	the size or the structure of a table, using <code>SELECT *</code> could very well initiate a query that takes hours if the table is large enough.
	In practice, I have found the act of stopping a query (sometimes referred to casually as "killing" the query) easy enough to do in
	SQL Server Management Studio. I have found it to lock up other programs (such as SQL Developer). If you ever have a query that 
	continues to run for a while (referred to casually as a query that's "spinning"), you can cancel it is SSMS by pressing the red "Stop"
	button:</p>
	
	<p>There are two options I tend to prefer if I don't know the size of the table, or if there is risk that a <code>SELECT *</code> will
	take time to complete:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>Use <code>SELECT TOP 10 *</code>, which will return the top 10 records. You can change the number 10 to any number
	you prefer. Also, if your query is written with logic that filters results, only the top 10 records that meet the filtering 
	criteria will be displayed. <b>Note:</b> the TOP keyword does not exist in PL/SQL.</li>
	<li>Right-click on a table in the Object Explorer, and select "Select Top 1000 Rows." A query is then self-generated. 
	The benefit of this option is that for a table with many columns, reading the fields is much easier. You can also copy/paste
	field names or the table name.</li>
	</ul>
