  <h5 class="title">1. Intro to Single-Table Queries</h5>
	<p>Data within relational databases are stored in tables as observations, or <b>records</b>. Each record has one or more <b>fields</b>, or columns.
	If you're familiar with Excel Pivot tables, relational data are essentially the original, un-pivoted data.
	The table excerpt below demonstrates the structure of tables within relational databases.</p>

	Single-table queries are the foundation of SQL. A single-table query is simply what it says: a query on a single table. A query is (usually) a small program
	that specifies what to return from a table. Queries can "filter" results, they can aggregate results, and they can sort them. Imagine you work at a bank and have
	a table with checking accounts. You want to return checking accounts that are inactive. A pseudo-query may look like:</p>
	
	<pre><code>
select account#
from checkingaccountdata
where status = 'inactive'
	</code></pre>
	
	<p>The query can be read as follows: <code>select</code> the <code>account#</code> field from the <code>checkingaccountdata</code> table 
	for all records where another field, <code>status</code>, is equal to "inactive". Note that SQL is <b>NOT</b> case sensitive. It does not
	care whether you capitalize or not. This is not true for all programming languages, however.</p>

  <h5 class="select">2. The <code>SELECT</code> Statement</h5>
	<p>The <code>SELECT</code> statement is the mother of all statements. The base requirement for a query is the <code>SELECT</code> statement. As shown above,
	this statement essentially tells the server precisely what you want to see. Without it, there is no query.</p>
	<p>Because the <code>SELECT</code> statement is the only required piece of a query, all other components are usually referred to as <b>clauses</b>,
	which are simply qualifiactions to the statement. Telling the statement what table to look at and how to look at it are common clauses--so common, in fact, that
    the distinction between the <code>SELECT</code> statement and the <code>FROM</code> clause is mostly a semantic issue.</p>	
	<p>I have only used the <code>SELECT</code> statement by itself in practice to perform basic operations. Unlike some programming languages, such as R or Excel VBA,
	SQL does not have a "console," which is essentially a command line. In other languages, this is where you could easily and quickly return a result, such as the 
	square root of 898. Without a console, the code must be written within the script:</p>	
	
		<pre><code>
select sqrt(898)
		</code></pre>
	
	<p>Note that these kind of operations in SQL are usually much more difficult to program than simply arriving at the answer using a calculator.
	This is due to a number of reasons, such as T-SQL not supporting complex numbers as well as floating-point precision. For example,</p> 

		<pre><code>
select 50/100
		</code></pre>
	
	<p>returns 1. This is because SQL reads 50 and 100 as integers and returns the nearest integer (i.e., 0.5 gets rounded to 1). For issues related to
	floating-point precision and numeric values, see <a href="../Programming/index.html#numeric">a description</a> of numeric variables in programming.</p>

	<p>Most applications of the <code>SELECT</code> statement will include use of a table. From a table, the statement will usually refer to fields, aggregations of fields,
	or manipulations of existing fields.</p>
